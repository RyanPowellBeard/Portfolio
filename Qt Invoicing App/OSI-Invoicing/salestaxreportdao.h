// Basis is read from CompanyDAO::getCompany().accrual at call time:
//   - Accrual: sales are dated by invoices.issue_date. All non-Void
//     invoices in range count, regardless of payment status.
//   - Cash: sales are dated by when an invoice was actually paid off.
//     SIMPLIFICATION (v1): only invoices that are FULLY paid count, dated
//     on their completing (most recent) payment. An invoice with partial
//     payments recorded in-range but not yet fully paid off contributes
//     nothing until it's fully paid. Proportionally allocating a partial
//     payment across an invoice's line items is not implemented.
//     This could change, but more research is required on the laws....
